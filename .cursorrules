# Temporal VR Project Rules for Cursor AI

## Research Vision
This project aims to create a VR system where time becomes a tangible, 
spatial dimension for 3D modeling. Users can "sculpt time" to create 
evolving 3D objects.

## Key Innovations
1. Time as 4th spatial dimension
2. Temporal Brush system
3. Multi-timeline manipulation
4. Real-time preview at 90 FPS

## Target
SIGGRAPH Asia 2026 Technical Paper
Focus: Novel interaction paradigm + Technical implementation

## Project Overview
- Goal: SIGGRAPH Asia 2026 submission about temporal parametric modeling in VR
- Start Date: 2025-06-26
- Deadline: ~May 2026 (11 months)
- Tech Stack: Blender 4.4 (Python), Unity 2022.3.55 LTS (C#), OpenXR

## Core Concept
Users manipulate time as a 4th dimension in VR to create evolving 3D models.
Example: Sketch a tree's growth over time, generating its full lifecycle.

## Current Status
- Phase: Day 1 - Project Initialization
- Progress: 0%
- Focus: Setting up development environment

## Today's Goals
1. Set up project structure
2. Install required software
3. Create first proof-of-concept script
4. Initialize version control

## Coding Standards
### Blender Python
- Use Blender 4.4 API
- Follow PEP 8
- Add type hints
- Document all functions

### Unity C#
- Use Unity 2022.3.55 features
- Follow C# conventions
- Optimize for VR (90 FPS target)
- Use XR Interaction Toolkit

## Development Philosophy
- Start simple, iterate fast
- Document everything
- Test in VR frequently
- Keep performance in mind
